If you like verbose code and anemic objects this pattern is to you.

Well, I'm just joking, but in a real project a architecture like that must have a real purpose, this is a simple example of the approach, and as you can see, there are a lot of folders, classes and everything.

I will read more about this architecture and search for more opinions between my coleagues, even the ones that don't work with .Net.
